# Audio_Flashcards
This project is in the very early stages of development. So far the Web page and javascript is not in use. This project does contain a python script which does successfully convert quizlet cards, into a CSV file. However, this does not function with the web interface at the moment.

# Notes
Was going to use JSON, but you cant write to files easily on browser for security reasons. I have used indexedDB in the past and that seems like a logical option.
